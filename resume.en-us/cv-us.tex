  \title{\em North East Line ISCS Upgrade}
  \dates{July\ 2011--Present}
  \begin{position}
    This project has a unique blend of constraints with its direct impact on
    Singapore's citizens, its very large number of interfaces, and the sheer
    amount of functions needed to control every aspects of the line's
    operations. The ISCS enables only 7 operators to run the entire fleet of 32
    driver-less trains, monitor the 40km of tracks, the various energy circuits
    (air, water, electricity) and efficiently communicate among operators,
    contractors and with the public. Development progress is tracked using JIRA
    and Primavera, testing automation relies on Jenkins, VMWare, Sikuli, Apache
    and languages most used are C++, Tcl/Tk, Python and shell scripts. I
    personally overlooked the development of the entire tool chain, and
    contributed many updates and fixes into the project over the years, even
    during my position as a Project Manager.
  \end{position}

  \title{\em Mexico Ciudad Segura (Safe Mexico City)}

    Since 2009, Thales Group has been awarded with the deployment of a new
    integrated call center and security system for Mexico City. Some key
    figures: 6 operation centers to deploy, 8000 cameras to control, 25000
    ground resources to manage, 40000 calls received per day, 8 Millions people
    to protect. Knowledge of various technologies were required to work on this
    project: Team Foundation Server, C\# (with .Net components WCF, WPF, LinQ),
    Sharepoint, MSSQL, ActiveMQ, ServiceMix, etc. I was responsible for the
    development of a tracking component and the design of several interfaces. In
    addition to this, I contributed many fixes over my few years on this project.
  \end{position}

    scalability and ease of development. Built on top of a Message Oriented
    Middle-ware with XSD data-binding, ActiveMQ JMS, Web Services,
    JABX. Development languages consists of: C++, Java and Python. I personally
    started this product with development fundings. In 2013, this product became
    the basis of our offer in costal surveillance system and has been sold to 3
    governmental organisations since.
