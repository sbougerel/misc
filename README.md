# My Emacs Config
With the dark slate gray (a.k.a classic) theme, pager, whitespace extension, snippet, and flymode.

## Upgrade from Emacs 23
Actually Emacs 23 broke both flymode and snippets, so I got to port it.

# My ZSH config
In fact it's only the theme, which I like better with solarize.

# My English resume
Actually, my resume does not need to be hidden, so it's there too. It's based on the excellent (in my opinion) [res latex documentclass written by Michael DeCorte](https://www.rpi.edu/dept/arc/training/latex/resumes/), which is copyrighted works and does not belong to me.
